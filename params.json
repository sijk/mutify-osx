{"name":"Mutify","tagline":"Mute Spotify Ads","body":"I like [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). I don't like ads.\r\n\r\nI know, I could (and perhaps should) cough up for a premium subscription to get rid of the ads. I don't really use it enough to justify the expense, though. \r\n\r\n*Enter, Mutify...*\r\n\r\nMutify is a tiny program for Mac OS X that sits in the background listening for track-change notifications from Spotify. It uses some simple rules to figure out whether the current track is an ad, and if it is, it mutes Spotify. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nDownload [the installer](https://github.com/sijk/mutify-osx/raw/master/dist/Mutify.pkg). Double click it. \r\n\r\nDepending on your security settings, you may get a notice saying that the installer can't be opened because it's from an unidentified developer. If that happens, right-click on the installer and choose *Open*. \r\n\r\nOnce the installer has finished, Mutify will be running in the background. It will launch automatically whenever you log in. \r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n-   **Will it slow down my computer?**\r\n    No. Mutify uses [distributed notifications][1], which means that Spotify tells \r\n    it when tracks change; it doesn't have to keep asking. This makes it very \r\n    efficient. It also only uses a few megabytes of RAM. \r\n\r\n-   **Does it detect all ads?**\r\n    Yes, as far as I know. I can't guarantee that it will, but I can \r\n    say that I haven't heard an ad since I wrote this program. \r\n\r\n-   **It didn't mute an ad!**\r\n    Right-click on the album art panel in the bottom left corner of the window \r\n    and choose *Copy Spotify URI* while the ad is playing. \r\n    Open a bug report [here](http://github.com/sijk/mutify-osx/issues/new) and \r\n    paste in the URI of the ad that wasn't muted. \r\n\r\n-   **But I use Linux.**\r\n    Cool, me too. Check out http://sijk.github.com/mutify-linux.\r\n\r\n-   **But I use Windows.**\r\n    I don't. Sorry.\r\n\r\n-   **How do I uninstall it?**\r\n    You really want to uninstall Mutify? :cry:\r\n    Open Terminal.app and type in the following lines.\r\n\r\n        launchctl unload com.github.sijk.Mutify\r\n        rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.sijk.Mutify.plist\r\n        sudo rm /usr/local/bin/Mutify\r\n        sudo pkgutil --forget com.github.sijk.pkg.Mutify\r\n\r\n[1]: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDistributedNotificationCenter_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003653","google":"UA-38555144-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
